evilscan
===============

See the real [repo](https://github.com/eviltik/evilscan) for docs.

I wanted to use evilscan in an [electron app](https://github.com/nicksheffield/codecast), but having the geoip-lite dependency caused the app to be 100mb bigger than necessary.

This is just a version of evilscan with the geoip-lite dependency removed.
