# Delite Themes

Delite provides platform-specific themes for Android, iOS, and Blackberry.
There is also a generic theme named "bootstrap".

All themes are generated using the [Less CSS library](http://lesscss.org/).


## Creating a new theme from the bootstrap theme

To modify the bootstrap theme, you can change the colors
as well as other part of variables.less, and then compile:

1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).

2. `npm install`

3. `grunt css`
