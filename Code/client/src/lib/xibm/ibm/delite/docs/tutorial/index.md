# delite - creating custom components

## delite background
`delite` is a new JavaScript library to provide a UI framework for both desktop and mobile platforms <sup><a href="#link1">[1]</a></sup>.

This repository is intended to be used as the core building blocks to leverage current and future standards in HTML, CSS & JavaScript for the
purpose of writing reusable Web Components.

It can be used on its own but more likely used with other projects either from the [ibm-js repositories](https://github.com/ibm-js)
or other repositories.

More information can be found on the [delite website](http://ibm-js.github.io/delite/) explaining the standards this library aims to conform to.
