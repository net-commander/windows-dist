The *Control Freak* IDE provides already a sophisticated Editor which comes with auto completion and snippets by the default.

Since most developers prefer their own editors and key bindings, the IDE allows also to write driver code outside of the
IDE. All you you need to do is open the driver Javascript file and start coding. The IDE server will recognize file 
those changes and updates the running driver instance with your changes.
Be aware that you will loose the auto-completion of the IDE which shows common methods by default.


### Recommended Editors

- Best fit: WebStorm or PHPStorm with the "More Dojo" plugin enabled.
